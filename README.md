# Centralized SDK Demo

This branch contains a demo of using the [Config SDK](https://circleci.com/docs/circleci-config-sdk/) to centralize manage configuration files.

Please refer to [CircleCI's field guide](https://fieldguide.circleci-labs.com/advanced_concepts/centralized_config_management/) for how this works.
